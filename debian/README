The Debian Package cowprompt
----------------------------

 CowPrompt
**CowPrompt** is a simple wrapper program for `xcowsay` and `fortune` that can be used to display any message contained in a fortune data file to the screen.

## What it is for
The main intent for CowPrompt is to display writing prompts for writers taking part in self-challenges such as [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org), but can be used for any purpose where prompts need to be displayed onto the screen on demand.

## Why does CowPrompt need to exist? Why not just use *xcowfortune* which is also installed with *xcowsay*, or use *xcowsay's* existing functionality?
You could do that, but it would also pull from every fortune data file installed on the system by default (which may or may not be what you want). You could also pipe the output of fortune (or a specific fortune data file) through xcowsay

However, I wanted a simple way to be able to: a.) Configure the command to use only one fortune data file rather than all of them in *specific* cases (in this case, a fortune data file that specifically contained various creative prompts to try and help me get through writer's block)), and more importantly, b.) be able to invoke the command through a launcher on the desktop, application menu, or quick launch panel rather than through the command line, hence the desire for a wrapper script. So I made one for myself and decided to share it. It needed a fancy name, and thus, `cowprompt` was born.

## How it Works
By default, CowPrompt displays quotes from a combined set of **Brian Eno's** *Oblique Strategies* cards (Editions 1-4 with duplicates removed), but CowPrompt can be configured to use any specific fortune data file.

Various display options can be configured through editing the `cowprompt.conf` file and the `cowprompt` wrapper executable script.

## Dependencies
CowPrompt can work on any Linux or Unix based system running an X Windows environment that has [xcowsay](https://github.com/nickg/xcowsay) and [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) (or [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod)) available and installed on the system.

## How to Install
CowPrompt can be installed via binary package (.deb and .rpm provided via the [Releases](https://github.com/rtiangha/CowPrompt/Releases) section), or by copying the various files to their respective places onto the file system.

1. First, ensure that the software requirements (`xcowsay` and `fortune`) are installed first. Some examples on how are provided below.

### Debian/Ubuntu
`sudo apt-get install xcowsay fortune-mod`

### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
`sudo dnf install xcowsay fortune-mod`

### openSUSE
`sudo zypper install xcowsay fortune`

2. Next, install the CowPrompt package.

### DEB-based Distributions (ex. Debian/Ubuntu, etc.)
`sudo dpkg -i cowprompt.deb`

### RPM-based Distributions (ex. Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/openSUSE, etc.)
`sudo rpm -ivh cowprompt.rpm`

## How to Configure
Options to to change how/what CowPrompt displays are available via editing the `/etc/cowprompt.conf` file and/or the `/usr/bin/cowprompt` wrapper script. Instructions and examples are included within the files.

## How to Create New Prompts
CowPrompt can pull from any message contained in a valid fortune data file installed on the system. There are many sources to get fortune data files. Your operating system distribution may have additional ones that you can install outside of the default set, or you can find many on the internet that other people have made as well.

Creating your own is easy too. For example, [here is a tutorial](http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/fortune_makefile.php).

Once you've obtained or created your own custom fortune text and `.dat` files, make sure to copy them to where the other fortune data files live on your system (usually in `/usr/share/games/fortunes` but your distribution may vary) and then edit the `/usr/bin/cowprompt` wrapper script to use it instead of the default `Oblique` file.
