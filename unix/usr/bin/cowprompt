# cowprompt is a wrapper program that invokes xcowsay to display a prompt
# to the screen pulled from the list of valid fortunes available from the
# system.
#
# Change 'Oblique' to any valid installed fortune file (or its file path),
# or delete the fortune option entirely to have xcowsay pull a random fortune
# message from all available fortune files in the system. For example, to use 
# Edition 1 of the Oblique Strategies cards rather than the amalgam version, 
# change the DECKNAME variable to:
# 
# DECKNAME=Oblique-ed1
#
# or if your fortune data set lives in a different directory than the default
# (ex. /opt/fortunes), then enter the full file path like so:
#
# DECKNAME=/opt/fortunes/Oblique-ed1
# 
# To pull from all availablly installed fortune data files, leave DECKNAME blank:
# 
# DECKNAME=
#

DECKNAME=Oblique

# The cowprompt.config file is expected to be in /etc, but if it isn't or you
# have written and stored your own elsewhere, edit the CONFIGFILE variable
# to point to where the config file lives.

CONFIGFILE=/etc/cowprompt.config

exec fortune $DECKNAME | xcowsay --config=$CONFIGFILE
