# cowprompt is a wrapper program that invokes xcowsay to display a prompt
# to the screen pulled from the list of valid fortunes available from the
# system.
#
# Change 'Oblique' to any valid installed fortune file, or delete the fortune
# option entirely to have xcowsay pull a random fortune message from all
# available fortune files in the system. For example, to use Edition 1 of the
# Oblique Strategies cards rather than the amalgam version, change the exec
# command to:
#
# exec fortune Oblique-ed1 | xcowsay --config=/etc/cowprompt.config
#
# The cowprompt.config file is expected to be in /etc, but if it isn't,
# edit the argument option to point to where the config file lives.

exec fortune Oblique | xcowsay --config=/etc/cowprompt.config

exit 1;
