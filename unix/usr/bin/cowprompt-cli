# cowprompt-cli is a wrapper program that invokes cowsay to display a prompt
# to the screen pulled from the list of valid fortunes available from the
# system.
#
# You may also use any of the standard cowsay command line options to change
# the look of the cow. See the cowsay(6) man page for more information.
#
# Change 'Oblique' to any valid installed fortune file (or its file path),
# or delete the fortune option entirely to have xcowsay pull a random fortune
# message from all available fortune files in the system. For example, to use 
# Edition 1 of the Oblique Strategies cards rather than the amalgam version, 
# change the DECKNAME variable to:
# 
# DECKNAME=Oblique-ed1
#
# or if your fortune data set lives in a different directory than the default
# (ex. /opt/fortunes), then enter the full file path like so:
#
# DECKNAME=/opt/fortunes/Oblique-ed1
# 
# To pull from all availablly installed fortune data files, leave DECKNAME blank:
# 
# DECKNAME=
#

DECKNAME=Oblique

# The cowsay program takes command line options to modify the look of the cow.
# If you wish to change how the cow looks, enter the options below. See the
# cowsay(6) man page for more information.
